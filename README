NAME
       blind - Collection of command line video editing utilities

DESCRIPTION
       blind is a collection of command line video editing utilities. blind uses a
       custom raw video format with a simple container. If you have a video file
       you want to edit, you first have to convert it with blind-from-video(1). To
       be able to play your video in a video play, you have to convert it with
       blind-to-video(1).

       Raw video takes up tremendous amount of space, you should therefore avoid
       storing the video without first convert it with blind-to-video(1).
